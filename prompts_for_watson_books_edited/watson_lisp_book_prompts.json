It generates a SPARQL query using these parameters to check if the given `entity-uri` is of type `type-value-uri`, and then executes the query using the `query` function.The generated SPARQL query uses the `ask` keyword to return a boolean value (true or false) indicating whether the given triple exists in the graph. The `bgp` keyword is used to specify a basic graph pattern, which consists of a single triple pattern. The `triple` keyword is used to define the triple pattern, where the subject is the `entity-uri`, the predicate is `rdf:type`, and the object is the `type-value-uri`.The generated SPARQL query is then printed to the console using the `format` function, and the query is executed using the `query` function. The result of the query, which is a boolean value, is returned.You can call this function by passing the URIs of the entity and the type value you want to check. For example:```(ask-is-type-of <http://example.org/entity1> <http://example.org/typeValue1>)```This will check if the entity with URI http://example.org/entity1 is of type http://example.org/typeValue1."

Preprocess the text: Remove any unnecessary punctuation and stopwords from the text. Tokenize the text into individual words or sentences.2. Extract important entities: Use an entity recognition tool, such as entities_dbpedia, to identify and extract important entities from the text. These entities could be people, organizations, locations, etc.3. Summarize the text: Use a text summarization tool, such as categorize_summarize, to generate a summary of the text. This summary will give you the main points and the context of the text.4. Formulate the question: Based on the extracted entities and the summarized text, think about what kind of question you want to ask. The question should be specific, clear, and relevant to the text.5. Generate the question: Use the extracted entities and the summarized text to construct the question. You can use a combination of template-based and rule-based approaches. For example, if the text is about a person, you can ask What is the role of [person's name] in [organization]? or What achievements has [person's name] made?6. Evaluate the question: Check if the generated question is meaningful and can be answered based on the given text. Make sure the question is not too simple or too complex.Note: The mentioned dependencies are software packages that can be used in the implementation of the above steps."
