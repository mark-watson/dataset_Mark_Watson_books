This way, instead of directly mutating the state, we create a new state structure with the updated values.This pattern is known as functional immutability, where data structures are not modified once created, but new data structures are created with the desired changes. This approach has several advantages, including better code maintainability, improved concurrency, and easier debugging.In Haskell, one way to achieve this pattern is through the use of algebraic data types, also known as ADTs. ADTs allow you to define a data type with multiple constructors, each representing different possible states of your computation. By using pattern matching, you can then update the state by creating new instances of the ADT with different values.For example, let's say we want to represent a simple counter that can be incremented or decremented. We could define an ADT called CounterState with two constructors: Increment and Decrement, each taking an integer argument:```haskelldata CounterState = Increment Int | Decrement Int```We can then define a function `updateCounter` that takes the current state and an input value, and returns a new instance of CounterState based on the input:```haskellupdateCounter :: CounterState -> Int -> CounterStateupdateCounter (Increment x) n = Increment (x + n)updateCounter (Decrement x) n = Decrement (x - n)```This function pattern matches on the current state and performs the necessary update based on the input value.By using this pattern, we can maintain the state of our computation without directly mutating values, making our code more robust and easier to reason about."

Data.List: Provides functions for manipulating lists.2. Data.Maybe: Offers functions to handle optional values.3. Data.Map: Implements a data structure for key-value associations.When it comes to third-party modules, Haskell has a rich ecosystem with numerous libraries available via the package manager cabal or stack. You can search for modules that align with your application's requirements. Some well-regarded third-party modules in Haskell include:- lens: Provides powerful abstractions for manipulating complex data structures.- aeson: A library for JSON serialization and deserialization.- text: Offers optimized text handling functions and types.After determining the useful functions, you can proceed to write and test your pure Haskell functions.

Don't be discouraged if you find certain concepts challenging at first. Keep experimenting, writing code, and engaging with the material.
